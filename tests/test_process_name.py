"""Evolver says its own name in the Windows task list.

Windows takes what it shows about a process -- the Details tab's name, the
Processes tab's description, the icon beside it -- from the file the process was
started from, so a plain ``pythonw.exe`` puts Evolver in the task list as one more
anonymous "Python".  That costs nothing until something strands a process, and
then the task list is the only way back and cannot say which row is safe to end
among half a dozen identical ones belonging to different apps.

``app_support.process_identity`` makes a copy of the interpreter named,
described and marked for this app.  This process cannot be named on the way in
-- writing the copy takes the very interpreter being named -- so each run makes
it for the run after, and the shortcut is pointed at it once it exists.
